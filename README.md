# Bitcoin Wallet

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, self-custody Bitcoin wallet from scratch, providing complete control and security over Bitcoin transactions and storage. This wallet will be lightweight, secure, and designed to align with Bitcoin’s principles of decentralization and trustlessness.

## Premise
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, and the core ethos of its ecosystem is to empower users with full control over their funds without relying on third parties. This project aims to:

1. **Eliminate Dependence on Third Parties**: Provide the tools needed to manage Bitcoin securely without relying on custodial wallets or services.
2. **Enhance User Understanding**: Build the wallet in a way that fosters a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s underlying principles and technical mechanisms.
3. **Maintain Robust Security**: Implement best practices for cryptographic key generation, transaction signing, and secure storage of sensitive data.

## Features
The wallet will include:
- **Mnemonic (Seed Phrase) Generation**: Generate and manage a mnemonic seed phrase based on the BIP-39 standard.
- **HD Wallet Functionality**: Support hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet standards (BIP-32, BIP-44, BIP-84) for key and address generation.
- **Address Types**: Generate and handle Legacy (P2PKH), SegWit (P2SH), and Native SegWit (Bech32) address formats.
- **Balance Checks**: Query balances for wallet addresses via public APIs or self-hosted Bitcoin nodes.
- **Transaction Creation and Signing**: Build, sign, and broadcast transactions securely.
- **Transaction History**: Retrieve and display transaction data for wallet addresses.
- **Offline and Online Modes**: Provide offline transaction signing and online broadcasting for enhanced security.

## Development Approach
1. **Incremental Feature Development**: Build the wallet step-by-step, ensuring that each component is fully functional and secure before adding more complexity.
2. **Security by Design**: Prioritize secure coding practices and encryption for handling private keys and sensitive data.
3. **Open Source Tools**: Leverage reliable open-source libraries like `bitcoinjs-lib`, `bip39`, and `bip32` while maintaining full transparency and control.
4. **Educational Focus**: Document every step of development to create an educational resource for others interested in Bitcoin wallet development.

## Getting Started
To begin developing or using the wallet:

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd bitcoin-wallet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using Node.js**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the initial setup script (coming soon)**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-signature wallet support.
- Integration with hardware wallets.
- Advanced privacy features (e.g., CoinJoin).
- Lightning Network support for faster, low-fee transactions.
